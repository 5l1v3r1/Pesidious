# Malware Mutation using Deep Reinforcement Learning and GANs

The purpose of our project is to use artificial intelligence to mutate a malware sample to bypass anti-virus agents while keeping its functionality intact. In the past, notable work has been done in this domain with researchers either looking at reinforcement learning or generative adversarial networks as their weapons of choice to modify the states of a malware executable in order to deceive anti-virus agents. Our solution makes use of a combination of deep reinforcement learning and GANs in order to overcome some of the limitations faced while using these approaches independently.
